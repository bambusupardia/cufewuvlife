Leinart went to star at USC and win the Heisman Trophy before playing in the NFL.</p><p>“I respected Colt for not transferring,” Rollinson said. “(His death) is extremely sad news. Obviously, you’re shocked. A lot of ex-players are checking in and texting me. For the Mater Dei football community, it’s very sad. … Colt was such as great kid.”</p><p>Rollinson remembered Brennan’s “million dollar” smile and the support he received from his father, especially after a serious car accident in 2010.</p><p>“He was always by Colt’s side,” Rollinson said of Terry Brennan. “My prayers go out to Terry and the Brennan family.”</p><p>After graduating from Mater Dei, Brennan went to the University of Colorado, but legal issues forced him to leave the school.</p><p>He enrolled at Saddleback College for the 2004 season. In his one season there, he completed 68 percent of his passes for 2,532 yards and 23 touchdowns with only four interceptions and was named All-Empire Conference first team.</p><p>This is a breaking news story and will be updated.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6S5tXnBq5ynppGjerOxwqipnWWjmsG1tc2gZKqaXZu%2FsLmMppitnaJisaa1jKGgoKBdqK6lsMuemZqbm2KwsLjLnp6eZZSarqV5wK1kbG9f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
