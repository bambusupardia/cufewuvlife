Truth Revealed</h2><p>There are speculations in the web world that “<strong>Is Manel Kapel Lebanese?</strong>” however this assertion lacks actual proof.&nbsp;Manel is Angolan-Portuguese, which means he was born in Angola and speaks Portuguese.&nbsp;While Arabic is the official language of the Lebanese, Manel does not speak it, and his family origins are not from Lebanon.
