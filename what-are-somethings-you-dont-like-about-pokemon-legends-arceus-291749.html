Agreed with all of it. A few more:<p>- The fact that getting a full Dex with Research Level 10 on everything isn't enough to get 10 star. I saw it coming and have been doing bonus research tasks along the way, but the reality of now being "done" with the Pokedex but having to fill out another thousand points in arbitrary tasks just feels REALLY bad.</p><p>- The storage limitations and the main enemy of the game imho Bagin. The money sink and aggravation of the increased inventory management concerns add absolutely nothing positive to the game. They could've given us a full sized satchel from the start and the game would've just been better for it.</p><p>- The fact that the only way to get Nature mints is by RNG from the fields. Having to potentially process a dozen or more harvests to get the one Nature Mint you want is just bad design.</p><p>- The fact that you can't auto-organize the Pastures. Let me sort my Pokemon by number, or name, or type, or whatever other criteria I want, and not have to spend an hour manually doing so!</p><p>- The INSANE amount of cutscenes. Cutscenes summarizing the cutscenes we just watched! It's an insane amount of disrespect for their audience's time and intelligence and actively detracts from the game.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. I know getting a full Dex doesn't get you to 10 for a reason after all XD I'll probably post the things I did like in a moment. But certain things just drive me wild, and it would take so little to improve the quality of life in the game So Much, so I don't understand the design decisions at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy4tMCtZJqqlWLAsLnErZ%2Bippeoerq71GabqKakYrmqt8RmmJunpal6sbvKnqSopl2hsqixzZ2qZpmimLK2v41rcGpvZG58sa3GnmRt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
