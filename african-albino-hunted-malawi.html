Recently, the southern African nation of Malawi has seen a devastating surge in these attacks.</p><p>A new <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> from Amnesty International reveals that this April was the deadliest month yet, with four Malawian albinos murdered, including one baby.</p><p>All in all, the report found that since 2014, 18 albinos have been killed, with another five kidnapped and still missing, and 69 total criminal cases with albino victims on the books.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-78156 alt="Albino Child" width=900 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/albino-child.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78156 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>GIANLUIGI GUERCIA/AFP/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body> An albino child sits between his parents in the traditional authority area of Nkole, Machinga district, on April 17, 2015.</span></p><p>Most of these victims are killed so that their bones and/or internal organs can be either kept as tokens of good luck or, more likely, be sold to witchdoctors either in Malawi or some neighboring countries, including Mozambique.</p><p>One of this April’s victims has just such a story, a kind of story that’s now all too common.</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Davis Fletcher Machinjiri went out to watch a soccer game when he was attacked by four men who took him to Mozambique and killed him. Malawian police <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that “the men chopped off both his arms and legs and removed bones. They then buried the rest of his body in a shallow grave.”</p><p>With so many albinos like Machinjiri brutally killed, Amnesty International writes that “Malawi’s 7,000 to 10,000 people with albinism live in fear of losing their lives to criminal gangs who, in some instances, include close family members.”</p><p>In addition to the fear of losing their lives, albino women also face the threat of rape as a result of local beliefs that having sex with a person with albinism will cure HIV/AIDS.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-78155 alt="Albinos Being Hunted And Killed In Malawi" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/african-albino.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78155 class=wp-caption-text>Femia Tchulani, a 42-year-old Malawian albino woman, stands outside her house on April 18, 2015 in Blantyre. <span class=credit>GIANLUIGI GUERCIA/AFP/Getty Images</span></p><p>In response to the tide of rape and murder, Malawi’s government has condemned the attacks, appointed a special legal counsel, and created a “National Response Plan,” but the new Amnesty International report claims that these measures have failed, particularly because punishments are not severe enough to deter future offenders.</p><p>Furthermore, the report suggests that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Malawi’s widespread poverty</a> is largely responsible for the crimes committed against albinos, with attackers believing they can make large sums of money by selling albino body parts.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-78157 alt="Albino Person In Malawi" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/albino-malawi.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78157 class=wp-caption-text>Mainasi Issa, a 23-year-old Malawian albino woman, carries her two-year-old daughter Djiamila Jafali as she poses outside her hut in the traditional authority area of Nkole, Machinga district, on April 17, 2015. <span class=credit>GIANLUIGI GUERCIA/AFP/Getty Images</span></p><p>But whatever the underlying reasons for the attacks, Malawi’s albinos are so victimized that the population is now facing extinction.
