Gamers have a few theories as to why this is.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-halo-infinite-8217-s-spartan-locke>What Happened To Halo Infinite’s Spartan Locke?</h2><p>Netizens think Spartan Locke of Halo Infinite has died. Thus, many fans wonder where they missed him and how the story took a turn where he was no more seen.</p><p>He was one of the main characters in the game. In Halo season 5, Master Chief was discovered by the Guardians, Spartan Locke, and Fireteam Osiris, who confirmed that he is not a traitor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/hmJrgVypwWo/maxresdefault.jpg><p>Unfortunately, they’ve already been put in a worse predicament. Cortana has returned, she is a traitor, and she and her AI companions have launched a war on the universe.</p><p>Later, the Infinity is involved in a combat engagement in the orbit of a Halo ring, where Halo Infinite begins. In the Infinite series, there is hardly any physical appearance of Spartan Locke.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Punisher got a new logo and I hate it. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/w1jy7i4fdT</a></p>— Nathan Hale ?? (@wlfhuntr34) <a href=#>December 20, 2021</a><p>There is one mention to him in the form of a UNSC Audio Log collectible. Dr. Halsey suggests sending Locke to Zeta Halo to remove Cortana until Chief rejects and accepts the assignment.</p><p>Several&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>sources</a>&nbsp;mentioned that the creator had made significant changes in the characters’ storyline because they wanted to turn fans’ attention back on Master Chief.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=is-spartan-locke-dead>Is Spartan Locke Dead?</h2><p>Some people have speculated that Spartan Locke is probably dead in the Halo series. However, there is no concert evidence to prove such rumors.&nbsp;</p><p>However, many think the creators may not continue his storyline following this series. It may be saddening for many of his fans.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We never saw Locke die, you know. Sure, a Spartan Hunter got his helmet, but what if he survived that fight and became this hardened survivalist badass? I'd be down for seeing a Locke redemption like this. Humble him, then make him cool as fuck. <a href=#>https://t.co/tHH59B0qzq</a></p>— Spunge – 2% (@_spunge_) <a href=#>December 21, 2021</a><p>Moreover, a licensed Halo Infinite Mega Bloks toy set featuring a Jiralhanae Brute wearing Spartan Locke’s helmet as a shoulder pad was on sale before the game’s release. This Brute turns out to be Hyperius from The Hand of Atriox, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>WePC.&nbsp;</a></p><p>While a helmet isn’t proof of death, the Spartan-fate IV’s remains unknown for the time being. Thus, Spartan Locke’s situation appears to be dire for now.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=spartan-locke-height-how-tall-is-he>Spartan Locke Height- How Tall Is He?</h2><p>Spartan Locke has a height of 6ft 10 in and weighs 260lb.
