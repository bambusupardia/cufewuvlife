When authorities finally raided his Milwaukee apartment on July 22, 1991, and arrested him, they <a href=# rel=noopener>found</a> four heads, three skulls, and the remains of 11 people in his fridge.</p><p>What many true crime aficionados aren’t aware of, however, is that the child-raping and cannibalistic serial killer obsessively watched The Exorcist III (1990). Upon his arrest, Dahmer told Detective Dennis Murphy that he had bought a VHS copy of the film and watched it up to three times per week for six months straight.</p><p>“He felt the character in the movie was driven by evil, and he felt he could relate to the character because he felt he was driven by evil,” Murphy told jurors at Dahmer’s trial, which spanned from January 1991 to February 1992.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-339940 alt="Jeffrey Dahmer Bedroom" width=900 height=626 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/jeffrey-dahmer-bedroom.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-339940 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Milwaukee Police Department</span><span class=caption-body>Jeffrey Dahmer’s bedroom.</span></p><p>Most terrifying of all is that some of Dahmer’s victims had watched the movie with him — blissfully unaware that they would be murdered, skinned, and dismembered when it was over. Dangerously unaware, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards found Dahmer friendly enough to accept his $100 offer to pose naked.</p><p>Lured to the killer’s home under a fake pretense, Edwards was pointed to Dahmer’s fish tank. That’s when Dahmer handcuffed him and brandished a large knife, ordering him into the bedroom. Dahmer put on The Exorcist III and told Edward to sit on the bed — when the killer’s entire personality changed.</p><p>Edwards said Dahmer began “chanting … like a slow ‘uuhhmmm,’…and rocking back and forth.” After five hours of captivity, Edwards managed to beat Dahmer over the head and escape. He later <a href=# rel=noopener>testified</a> that “he put his head on my chest, was listening to my heart, and said he was going to eat my heart.”</p><p>After five hours of captivity, Edwards managed to beat Dahmer over the head and escape, leading to Dahmer’s arrest. Ultimately, The Exorcist III remains the only critically lauded sequel to the original. As for Jeffrey Dahmer, he was beaten to death in prison while serving 16 consecutive life terms on Nov. 28, 1994.</p><p>After learning about 11 murders inspired by horror movies, read about <a href=#>13 horror movies based on true stories</a>.
