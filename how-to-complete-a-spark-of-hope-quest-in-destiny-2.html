He is the bald-headed, blue Titan gazing over <strong>The Last City</strong>, North West of where you spawn into The Tower. If Zavala does not offer you the quest, it can be found in the <strong>Quest Archive</strong> via the <strong>Terminal</strong>, which is located to the left of <strong>Postmaster</strong> <strong>Kadi 55-30</strong>. Once the quest has been retrieved, progress can be tracked in the <strong>Quests</strong> tab in your <strong>Director.</strong> If you find yourself lost, both <strong>Zava</strong> and the <strong>Quest Archive</strong> can be found on the map.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Complete A Spark of Hope in Destiny 2</h2><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>The first step of <strong>A Spark of Hope</strong> in Destiny 2 is to talk to <strong>Commander Zavala</strong>, which you should have already done to begin the quest. Next, speak to <strong>Ikora Rey</strong> found in the <strong>Bazaar</strong> section of <strong>The Tower</strong>. Opening the map, hovering over <strong>Ikora</strong>, and adding a <strong>Waypoint</strong> will add a diamond to your HUD, guiding you directly to her. Unfortunately, Hunters currently don’t have a <strong>Vanguard </strong>representative, as their previous one — Cayde-6 —was killed in the now-removed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forsaken expansion</a>. After speaking to Ikora, you will need to visit <strong>Devrim Kay</strong> in the <strong>EDZ</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Destiny-2-Devrim-Kay.jpg><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true><strong>Devrim Kay</strong> is located in the <strong>Trostland</strong> section of the <strong>EDZ.</strong> The <strong>EDZ</strong> (short for European Dead<strong> </strong>Zone) is a separate <strong>Destination</strong> from <strong>The Tower</strong> and can be flown to via the <strong>Destinations</strong> menu. Once you have selected the <strong>Trostland Landing Zone</strong>, head inside the Church directly in front of you and ascend to the top, where you will find the charming marksman, <strong>Devrim Kay.</strong> Devrim asks you to clear out three <strong>Lost Sectors</strong>; <strong>Terminus East</strong>, <strong>Widow’s Walk</strong>, and <strong>Atrium</strong>.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false><strong>Lost Sectors</strong> are hidden areas found in most Destinations, marked with two arches and a circle. Each Lost Sector is filled with enemies and a boss, with a cache being awarded when the boss is defeated. Lost Sectors scale with your <strong>Power Level </strong>and are easy to complete by yourself, but you are free to bring friends along if you wish.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Atrium, Terminus East, and Widow’s Walk Lost Sectors</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Atrium-Destiny-2.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false><strong>Atrium</strong> can be found in the church itself. Jump down from the platform Devrim is on and head straight forward, stopping before the final set of pillars. To the right, there will be an <strong>open hatch</strong>. Head down the hatch, through the tunnel, and complete the Lost Sector by defeating the boss and opening the Cache.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Terminus-East-Destiny-2.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>To find <strong>Terminus East</strong>, head out of the church, past the entrance to Atrium, and turn directly East. <strong>Run over to the building with rusted panels</strong>, and you should be able to spot the Lost Sector symbol on the wall. Crouch or slide under the door and continue forwards through the tunnel to start the Lost Sector.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Widows-Walk-Destiny-2.jpg><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true><strong>Widow’s Walk</strong> is directly West of the church’s exit and Terminus East’s entrance. You will find the Lost Sector symbol sprayed on a <strong>wooden plank outside of a building</strong>. Enter the building and go through the open door on the right, making your way through each open entrance until you reach a flight of stairs. Make your way down and follow the path to start the <strong>Widow’s Walk Lost Sector.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Risk/Reward</h3><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>Return to <strong>Devrim</strong> with the map fragments you found in each of the Lost Sector Caches you looted. This will open up a separate quest, <strong>Risk/Reward</strong>, which is required to complete <strong>A Spark of Hope</strong>. Open up the <strong>Cosmodrome</strong> Destination in the <strong>Destinations</strong> menu. A new activity titled <strong>Risk/Reward</strong> will now be available, which you need to complete. This activity is easy enough to complete by yourself, and you will be guided the entire way through. By the end of the activity, you will have been rewarded <strong>Riskrunner</strong>, an electrifying <strong>Exotic</strong> submachine gun.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Once you’ve completed <strong>Risk/Reward</strong>, return to <strong>Zavala</strong> in <strong>The Tower</strong> to complete <strong>A Spark of Hope</strong> and receive a nice new <strong>Emblem</strong>. If you’re looking for another <strong>Exotic weapon</strong> to add to your Destiny 2 collection as a New Light, the Halo-inspired <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forerunner Exotic sidearm</a></strong> should be next on your list.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false><strong>Destiny 2</strong>&nbsp;is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
