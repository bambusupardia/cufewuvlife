Well, now is your chance. But there’s one catch: You have to be a cat person.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>God’s Little People Cat Rescue</a>, a privately-funded charitable organization devoted to caring for cats, is seeking a new recruit to take over the care of 55 cats on the “small paradise” Greek island of Syros. This is a paid opportunity that also includes free rent in a house with a view of the Aegean Sea, plus they’ve even thrown in water and electricity for free.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-185711 alt="Cat On Ledge" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cat-on-ledge.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-185711 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>God’s Little People Cat Rescue/Facebook</span></p><p>According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>BBC</a>, the sanctuary’s owner, Joan Bowell, is looking for a candidate who is over the age of 45, and who is “responsible, reliable, honest, practically inclined – and really, with a heart of gold.” Also, most important of all, you must love cats.</p><p>The job post says that they are seeking&nbsp;“a mature and genuinely passionate cat lover who knows how to handle many cats and would love their company.” And,&nbsp;unsurprisingly, the description also says that “cat-whispering skills should come natural” to the ideal candidate.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-185695 alt="Cats Outside Sanctuary" width=900 height=479 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cats-outside-sanctuary.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-185695 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>God’s Little People Cat Rescue/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Some of the cats that need to be looked after at the sanctuary.</span></p><p>However, this dream job might not be the right fit for someone who is a people person.</p><p>“You’ll no doubt thrive best if you are the type of person who appreciates nature and likes tranquility – and rest comfortably in your own company,” the job description reads. “That said, you’ll never feel lonely in the company of the cats and you’ll be expected to live with a small handful of cats in your house.”</p><p>The candidate also needs to know a bit about cat psychology and will have to be able to drive a stick-shift car, just in case one of the cats needs to be taken to the vet. Those who are trained veterinarian nurses will also receive special consideration if they apply for the position.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-185712 alt="Cat Standing On Ledge" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cat-standing-on-ledge.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-185712 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>God’s Little People Cat Rescue/Facebook</span></p><p>The person accepted will be taking a long-term position for a minimum of six months and would be filling in for Bowell, an artist, while she is away.</p><p>Since it was posted earlier this month, the post has been shared more than 32,000 times on Facebook and more than 200 people have expressed their interest to Bowell, according to the BBC.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-185696 alt="Greek Island Syros" width=900 height=479 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/greek-island-syros.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-185696 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>God’s Little People Cat Rescue/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>The Greek island of Syros.</span></p><p>And this dream job isn’t the only one of this sort to make the rounds on the internet. In Jan. 2018, a veterinary clinic in Ireland was looking for a <a href=# rel=noopener>professional cat cuddler</a> who could “pet cats for long periods of time, speak softly and can understand the different types of purring.”</p><p>Don’t worry dog people, there are plenty&nbsp;of opportunities&nbsp;for your dream job as well. In April 2018, The Points Guy made waves when they announced an opening for an intern position whose main duties included taking <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram photos of cute dogs</a>.</p><p>If you are an animal lover, you might want to start updating your resume in preparation for the next dream job posting.</p><p>Now that you’ve finished reading about a cat lover’s dream job, check out the unbelievable&nbsp;C.I.A. project called <a href=#>Acoustic Kitty</a> that intended to use cats outfitted with microphones to spy on the Soviets. Then discover the island of Aoshima, Japan, which is completely <a href=#>dominated by feral cats</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0xdGoqmabkal6tK3NnKuumaKueqSt0Z6rmqOVpw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
