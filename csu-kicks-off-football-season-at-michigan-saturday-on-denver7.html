Norvell is the fourth CSU head coach over the last nine seasons.</p><p><i><a class=Link href=# rel=noopener>Exclusive: Norvell talks CSU rebuild, quarterback whispering, and race in coaching</a></i></p><p>Redshirt freshman Clay Millen, who is expected to start for the Rams, is expected to be the first freshman starting quarterback for CSU since 2010. The Rams bring a starting offensive line with nearly 100 games under its belt, though they have never played together as a full unit, and only six starters on both offense and defense are returning.</p><p>It’s Colorado State’s first ever visit to Ann Arbor, and a win would be monumental for CSU. They come into the game as 30.5-point underdogs to the Wolverines, who are ranked No. 8 in the AP Poll and No. 6 in the AFCA Coaches Poll.</p><p>The Rams are 2-17 since 1993 against top-10 opponents and have not beaten a ranked team since defeating No. 6/7 Colorado in 2002. They are 13-36 since 1993 against ranked opponents.</p><p>The Rams and Wolverines have only ever played once before, when Michigan beat CSU 24-14 in the 1994 Holiday Bowl in San Diego.</p><p>Michigan finished last season ranked No. 3 in both polls – the highest end-of-season ranking since 1999. They have not lost a non-conference game under Jim Harbaugh.</p><p>Denver7 News at 9 a.m. precedes ABC’s coverage of the game. Georgia plays Oregon on Denver7 starting at 1:30 p.m., followed by Notre Dame and Ohio State starting at 5:30 p.m. Denver7 postgame coverage will start after the Fighting Irish-Buckeyes game, with Denver7 News at 10 to follow on Saturday night.</p><p>Denver7 on Local3 will also host two other CSU football games this season – on Saturday, Sept. 10 when Middle Tennessee plays in Fort Collins and on Sept. 24 when Sacramento State comes to CSU.</p><p>xfbml : true, version : 'v2.9' }); }; (function(d, s, id){ var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;} js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"; js.async = true; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6jCbrfInKKsZZ%2Bbs26yzqirm5mcoXq0scCspqdlkal6rrXCoaCgmZ5iwKLA1KubmrFdpLtusMSnrZ6qZ2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
