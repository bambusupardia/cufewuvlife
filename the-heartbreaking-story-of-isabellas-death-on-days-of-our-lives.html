The couple was thrilled to welcome their only child together, a son named Brady Black, in honor of the Brady family who had become so important to John over the years. Isabella loved being a mother to her little boy, but soon after she gave birth, things took a tragic turn. Isabella began to feel ill and had serious back pain. When she went to the doctor, she was told that she had pancreatic cancer and that she didn’t have much time to live.</p><p dir=ltr>After telling John the devastating news and saying a special goodbye to her close friends in Salem, Isabella went home to Venice where she begged John to take her so she could die in the place she felt most comfortable.

He obliged, scooped Isabella up into his arms, and held her as she took her final breath.</p><p dir=ltr>Although John and Isabella didn’t have much time together as husband and wife, she left a lasting impact on him as well as her son, Brady.</p><p>Post source: <a href=#>The List</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaeqmxwKurm6qVlriqusZmqq2noq56sLKMoqqampWhuaK%2FjJ2cmqyYYryvecOasKxln5t6sMHRZqOirpWofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
