Jane. Jada’s short hairstyle, on the other hand, isn’t a fashion choice, and she recently revealed that she shaved her head due to alopecia.</p><p>Will’s emotional reaction to the offensive joke prompted him to apologize to the comedian the next day on Instagram. Many celebrities have reacted to his actions in the aftermath, including actor Jim Carrey, whose comments on lawsuits have been misconstrued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/JIM-CARRE-1.jpg><h2>Will Smith Is Not Sued By Jim Carrey</h2><p>Confusion has swept the internet in the aftermath of Jim Carrey’s recent comments on CBS Mornings. During a breakfast show interview with Gayle King, he condemned Will Smith’s actions and discussed how he would have reacted if he were Chris Rock.</p><p>“I’d have announced this morning that I was suing Will for $200 million because that video is going to be there for the rest of time, it’s going to be everywhere.” “That insult will sting for a long time,” he predicted. Somehow, his words were taken out of context, and internet users incorrectly assumed that he was suing Will Smith, which is not the case.</p><p>He was simply stating that if he were Chris Rock, he would sue for $200 million.</p><h2>The Actor Gets in On The Chris Rock Slap</h2><p>On CBS Breakfast, Jim Carrey had a lot more to say about the situation and continued to criticize Will Smith’s actions.</p><p>“I felt sick. The standing ovation sickened me. I had the impression that Hollywood as a whole is spineless. “It felt like, ‘Oh, this is a really clear indication that we’re no longer the cool club,'” he said.</p><p>The Fresh Prince star “should have been arrested,” according to the 60-year-old, but Chris Rock “doesn’t want the hassle” of filing charges.</p><p>“You have no right to walk up on stage and smack someone in the face just because they said words… “It came out of nowhere because Will is frustrated inside,” he continued.</p><p>“It cast a pall over everybody’s shining moment,” the Truman Show star added.</p><h2>Will apologized publicly to Chris Rock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Will-Smithh-1.jpg><p>Moving on, Will apologized publicly to Chris Rock, viewers, and Oscars staff on Monday (March 28th) via Instagram.</p><p>“Violence, in all of its manifestations, is poisonous and destructive.” “My behavior at the Academy Awards last night was unacceptable and inexcusable,” he said in a statement.</p><p>“Jokes at my expense are part of the job,” he continued, “but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear, and I acted emotionally.”</p><p>The actor then publicly apologized to Chris, writing, “I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris.” I was out of line, and I was mistaken. I’m embarrassed, and my actions did not reflect the man I aspire to be.”</p><p>“I’d like to personally apologize to the Academy, the show’s producers, all attendees, and everyone watching around the world,” he continued, apologizing to Academy staff and viewers.</p><p>“I deeply regret that my behavior has tarnished what could have been an otherwise beautiful union for all of us.” “I’m still a work in progress,” the actor said.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jim Carry Suing Will Smith</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWanrpur8CrqbJlo6q2r7OMsKClpF2ouqrAx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
