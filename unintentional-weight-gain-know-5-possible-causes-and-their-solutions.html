A healthy diet and regular exercise are two important things that affect your body weight. But there are several factors that may play a role, including levels of physical activity, stress levels, sleep patterns and more. “You might not know there are many hidden factors which can be some unexplained factors behind weight gain,” Nutritionist Lovneet Batra mentions in one of her recent Instagram posts. Let’s take a look at these factors which you should not miss.</p><h2>Some common causes of&nbsp;unintentional weight gain</h2><h3>1. Stress</h3><p>Uncontrolled stress affects the secretion of hormones that regulate your eating habits. It can lead to more cravings and make you eat more than usual.

Therefore, try stress management techniques like meditation, yoga and exercise.</p><img decoding=async alt=5io2sdc8 id=story_image_main src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c.ndtvimg.com/2021-09/5io2sdc8_stress_625x300_14_September_21.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=ins_instory_dv_caption>Stress can affect your eating pattern<br><span class=ins_instory_span_credit>Photo Credit: iStock</span></p><h3>2.
