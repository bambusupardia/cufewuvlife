They performed a mashup of hits that included “Jealous,” “Cake By the Ocean,” and a fiery performance of “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker</a>.” And after a wildly successful night, Joe Jonas was in good spirits and headed to the Little White Wedding Chapel to say “I Do” to the new Mrs. Jonas,&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>.</p><p>The ceremony was just a legal formality, so the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">carefree couple</a>&nbsp;decided to have some nontraditional fun. An Elvis impersonator oversaw the nuptials while&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Diplo</a>&nbsp;assumed DJ responsibilities. Surrounded by A-list friends and family, the couple used Ring Pops as their wedding bands.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-at-sophie-turner-and-joe-jonas-las-vegas-wedding>What happened at Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas’ Las Vegas wedding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-wedding.jpg><p>“We had to do a legal marriage before we did a real big one,” Jonas told <a rel=noopener href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>. The performer explained, “It was either the courthouse or our version, and I preferred our version. Friends, Elvis, and Ring Pops.”</p><p>In a “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ask Me Anything</a>” segment for Elle, Turner explained she had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two weddings</a>. “Our first wedding day we had to legally get married in the states,” she reiterated.</p><p>The&nbsp;Survive&nbsp;star said the Elvis impersonator they hired as the officiant “ended up getting the Ring Pops out of the bin and the packet and selling it on eBay and sold like this whole story.” She quipped, “So, that was quite funny.”</p><h2 id=h-the-story-gets-funnier>The story gets funnier</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>At the time, the couple was planning an elegant traditional wedding ceremony in France. Since getting married in a Vegas wedding chapel constituted a civil ceremony, it fit the bill for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adventurous couple</a>.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe’s famous brothers</a>, Khalid, and other random friends were in attendance. The country duo Dan + Shay sang “Speechless” as Turner walked down the aisle. And Diplo unknowingly&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live-streamed the entire event</a>&nbsp;on social media.</p><p>Jonas later revealed to Jimmy Fallon he made a “pretty crucial mistake” (via <a rel=noopener href=#>Billboard</a>). He forgot to get the Elvis impersonator to sign a non-disclosure agreement. The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Camp Rock</a>&nbsp;star said, “We woke up, and we turn on the local news, and there he is.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, bidding for the “Joe Jonas ORIGINAL AUTHENTIC REAL WEDDING RING WRAPPER used by him in Las Vegas” started at $10. Bidding quickly got out of hand, with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Magazine</a>&nbsp;reporting it went as high as $4,000 before the online auction ended.</p><h2 id=h-the-formal-wedding-in-france>The formal wedding in France</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>A month after the wacky Vegas wedding, the second ceremony took place in the South of France at Chateau de Tourreau.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">W Magazine</a>, Maisie Williams from&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;was the maid of honor. Turner wore a long-sleeved Louis Vuitton gown. After the “emotional ceremony,” the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bride and groom</a>&nbsp;were smiling from ear to ear. One of the highlights of the special day was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the couple’s dog</a>&nbsp;Porky, dressed in a tuxedo.</p><p>Instead of the sour cherry Ring Pop, the “Only Human” singer gave his new wife a diamond-encrusted white gold wedding band. It matched her three-carat pear-cut diamond engagement ring. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brides</a>, it is valued at approximately $150,000.</p><p>In the Elle interview, Turner revealed that “it was the hottest day in French history – everyone was fainting and sweating. It was pretty nasty.” She continued, “It was a smelly wedding, but it looked great!”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Why Did Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner Have a Surprise Wedding?</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrKapoJmaerXB0aecq2WRo7Futs6eZKOnnpbAbrvFn6CcoZGjwW6%2FzqWbZqyYmnqztc2gZKmnoKh6tbTEsmSuq5WZeqLAjK2fnqGiYsOms8CsZLCdlJm2r7OO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
