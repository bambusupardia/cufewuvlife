Then I’m going to McDonald’s. I might crack open a bottle of white wine.”</p><p>The modern development boasts a 24-hour concierge team, as well as an energy centre, a swimming pool, a sauna and a gym.</p><p>The three-bedroom flat is also extremely secure and private, according to the Daily Mail newspaper.</p><p>The London-born star is now based in the US but she flew her team – including stylist Jamie Mizrahi, hair stylist Sami Knight and manicurist Michelle Humphrey – to the city ahead of the BRIT Awards.</p><p>Adele subsequently made an appearance on ‘The Graham Norton Show’, where she promised fans that her Las Vegas residency – which was postponed in January – will take place later this year.</p><p>She said: “We are now working our a**** off, but I don’t want to announce a new set of dates until I know everything will definitely be ready.</p><p>“The sooner I can announce the better, but I just can’t in case we are not ready in time. It is absolutely 100 percent happening this year.</p><p>“It has to happen this year because I’ve got plans for next year.”</p><p>The Grammy-winning star was previously forced to postpone her residency after COVID hit the production.</p><p>She said at the time: “I’m so sorry, but my show isn’t ready. We’ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and COVID. Half my crew … are down with COVID – they still are – and it’s been impossible to finish the show.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmpuepJWoeq27zZ2mp2WYpLqmecWemK2toprAbq2MsKCnnV2owbC%2BxGaYp5xdlrtusc2eqaCxXZiyr8DRnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
