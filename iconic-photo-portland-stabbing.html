Namkai-Meche was a recent college graduate who worked at a consulting firm.</p><p>Looking at the selfless nature of their actions, it’s unsurprising that the families of these heroes have responded only with messages of inclusivity and love.</p><p>Deliverance, in particular, was seen embracing Muslim women who approached her at the vigil.</p><p>Two Muslim nonprofits have raised more than $540,000 for the victims and their families with an online <a href=#>fundraiser</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Asha Deliverance, the mom of Portland hero Taliesin Meche, at a vigil for the victims.

The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are w/ them.</p><p>— President Trump 45 Archived (@POTUS45) <a href=#>May 29, 2017</a></p><p>Before sending this message, Trump published 21 other tweets on a range of other subjects.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging & demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!</p><p>— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>May 28, 2017</a></p><p>Critics wondered if the nature of the attack had something to do with the response — which came much later than Trump’s reactions to other attacks.</p><p>“He should learn from the Portland heroes,” a <a href=#>Chicago Tribune</a> writer suggested of the President. “When he responds more quickly and passionately to victims of Islamic terrorism, for example, than he does to domestic anti-Islamic terrorism, he becomes less of a problem-solver and more of a problem.”</p><p>Next, learn <a href=#>the real story behind the famous “Migrant Mother” photograph</a>.
