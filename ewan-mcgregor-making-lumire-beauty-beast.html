"Of course, there's many, many amazing actors who have played that role before and the last thing you would want to do is go ask them how to do it. And if it was a movie role, you wouldn't want to go watch that person do it because you want to make it your own. And I think the writing was very good and Bill Condon's wonderful direction is very good so I let them lead me and tried to make him my Lumière."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Playing a character with a French accent, McGregor revealed that speaking as Lumière took more than one try.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"The household items, we recorded all our dialogue so that when the actors who are doing the live action stuff are on set, they had voices to play back to...I went in to record mine, but my French accent wasn't really very good at all," he said. "Luckily Bill Condon, the wonderful director, I said to him, 'Look, please let me come back and do it again.' I came back here to New York and I got to re-record all of my dialogue again, so it's slightly more French now."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">McGregor said "Beauty and the Beast" is the first time he's sang in a movie since the 2001 musical, "Moulin Rouge!"</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"It's a very special thing to make music," he said. "If I hadn't been an actor, I think maybe that's what I would've liked to have done cause it's such a pleasure to make music and when you're recording a big number like this, it's very exciting to have an orchestra behind you."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Beauty and the Beast" hit theaters March 17.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">The Walt Disney Co. is the parent company of ABC News.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCRza2cq6yRnruusc2tZp6vkaN6rq%2FGq5ygp6JiuqK3yKeeZqSlorazsYybnJqtpK56o7HArKtoq6Skv7qLyJ10bW5hZoF4f5Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
