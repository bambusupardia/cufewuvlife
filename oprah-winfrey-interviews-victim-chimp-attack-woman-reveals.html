I don't want to wake up with nightmares," <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Charla Nash</a> said of the Feb. 16 attack by <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Travis</a>, the 200-pound chimp owned by her friend and employer, Sandra Herold.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Herold had called Nash to her Stamford, Conn., home that morning to help get Travis back in his cage.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nash, who turned 56 Tuesday, also told Winfrey on the show that aired Wednesday that she hoped her story would serve as a warning to others.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"These <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>exotic animals</a> are very dangerous and they shouldn't be around," she said in the interview during which she removed a dark veil and revealed that her face was missing eyes, her nose and lips. "There's a place for them that is not in residential areas."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Nash</a>, who wakes up every day in a hospital room at the Cleveland clinic where doctors change her bandages daily, told Winfrey she rarely touches her face to avoid knowing the full extent of her injuries.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I don't ask a whole lot about my injuries. I know that I have my forehead," she said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nash underwent several surgeries. Doctors used part of her leg to construct a new nose. They also rebuilt her tongue and cut a small hole in her face so she can eat.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">They also removed her eyes.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Now, Nash must drink her meals with a straw though a small hole where her mouth used to be. She said she longs for the day when she might be able to eat "a hot dog or piece of pizza."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka><a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>CLICK HERE to see Charla Nash's uncovered face.</a></strong></p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Despite her injuries, Nash seemed remarkably upbeat. She said she has no pain, was not angry and was ready to move on with her life rather than dwell on that day.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I'm the same person I've always been," she said. "I just look different. There are things that happen in life you can't change.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">"I don't think about it [the attack]. There's no time for that because I need to heal, you know, not look backwards."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCTrHpmqKiilrVuw8innaudqWK2r8DEq62inaeoere1wq2gpmWTnbauvIyaq62Zk6B6uLvMmqVmqpWrsqK40miqraeiroyqsJxyZ25xZ2eC</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
