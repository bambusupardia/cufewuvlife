The Husband should not be entitled to benefit from his fraud,” she claims in court docs.</p><p>Meanwhile, the battle over the exes’ <a href=# rel=noopener>$52 million mansion</a>, on Star Island, remains in contention as Lisa <a href=# rel=noopener>refuses to leave</a> even though the prenup “requires Wife to move or relocate from Husband’s separate and non-marital residential property, within thirty (30) days of the filing of the dissolution action.”</p><p>Lenny is asking the court to “enter an Order that establishes a date certain the Wife will vacate the residence in accordance with the Prenuptial Agreement” as he references their prenup, which states wife will “vacate the Marital Home then occupied by the parties within thirty (30) days” of a divorce filing.</p><p>Lenny states he has vacated the home and wants Lisa to do the same.</p><p>Lisa also wants <a href=# rel=noopener>Lenny’s girlfriend</a> Katharina to be banned from having any contact with her <a href=# rel=noopener>two children</a> with the successful plastic surgeon.</p><p>“The husband has exposed the minor children to his presumed girlfriend which is detrimental to the best interests of minor children,” Lisa states in court docs.&nbsp;“The husband’s presumed girlfriend, upon information and belief, has acted and continues to act in a manner that would be seen as injurious to the minor children, should she have any contact of access to the minor children at this time.”</p><p>Lisa, who reveals she is currently not dating anyone as she remains “loyal” to Lenny, also wants the court to establish a temporary parenting plan that will include “safeguards and parameters,” exclusive possession of the marital residence, and for Lenny to pay her legal fees.</p><p>The court has yet to rule.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqpikum64yKyYZqCfmLW0wMSipWavkaPBtHnTqGSipqaWuaqwwK2cZmldbnqutctmp6udnqq9cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
