The program will premiere on WOW on July 30th, featuring RuPaul as host and judge, as well as other judges, comedian Rhys Nicholson and longstanding Drag Race star Michelle Visage.</p><p>In the first episode, viewers will meet and learn about all of the queens. The first episode is described as follows:</p><p>“Mama Ru returns for more antics as 10 new queens from all around Australia and New Zealand battle for the title of Down Under’s Next Drag Superstar, with a $50,000 cash prize on the line this time.”</p><h2>Everything About Drag Race Down Under Season 2 Faux Fur</h2><p>According to her Twitter bio, Faux Fur is “SYDNEY’S LOUDEST BUT NOT THE BADDEST QUEEN.” The 27-year-old Queen is prepared to fight and send the other queens packing. In the Drag Race Down Under entrance video, she says of herself:</p><p>“Faux Fur, she’s fancy, she’s fashionable, but you can hear her from anywhere in the globe because she’s simply loud.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Faux-Fur-2-1.jpg alt="Faux Fur" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Faux Fur is of Vietnamese descent and has been performing drag for seven years, although she has “just recently found her feet.” Despite her extensive time in the drag scene, Faux Fur “only recently began to seize my own chances two years ago.” Things have changed for the better since then.&nbsp;Only a few queens in Sydney can compete with her high-energy theatrical performances. Her Instagram, @ fauxfur official, has photos of her performances as well as a few other pics for her over 5k followers.</p><p>When the “fierce, lively, fantastic” Faux Fur first entered the Sydney drag scene, she saw a paucity of Asian queens on stage and was eager to build her own place.&nbsp;During the epidemic in 2020, she discovered a means to communicate with her admirers from home. She began utilizing social media to establish her famous weekly Faux Mondays, an Instagram IGTV live show.&nbsp;The forum allowed not just other queens, but also members of the gay and POC queer communities to express their experiences in the hopes of encouraging others. According to cityhubsydney.com.au, she remarked on her venture:</p><p>“[We] instantly found methods to assist and develop one another in order to emerge from the epidemic in a better position.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Faux-Fur-3-1.jpg alt="Faux Fur" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Faux Fur has done it everything, from presenting an awards night as emcee to just dazzling everyone at the club with her performances.&nbsp;Despite this, some people believe that Faux Fur is “typically Asian,” “reserved” and “calm,” although she is “the polar opposite of quiet and submissive.” In response to the misperception, she stated:</p><p>“And I tell you, I’ve broken all the rules and gotten away with it. It’s simply my adorable face. I am the queen of all trades.”</p><p>She is unpredictable, so fans and judges on Drag Race Down Under may “expect the unexpected” from her. She would do everything on the program to send the other queens home, including “performing flips, cartwheels, and splits.”&nbsp;On July 30, watch Faux Fur perform on Drag Race Down Under at WOW.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Drag Race Down Under</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Faux Fur</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidmq2oYrO2voyopZ5ln5t6tbTEZpqopqSawLWtza2qZp6ipLpusNGanmaqkZiybrDOsKVmrZ6ZsrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
