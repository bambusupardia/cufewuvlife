He won the Mercury Prize in 2003 and has since been regarded as a grime classic. His subsequent albums – Showtime, Maths + English, and Tongue n’ Cheek – were equally well welcomed by the audience.&nbsp;Tongue n’ Cheek sold over 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. He’s also had a string of hit tunes, including Dance with Me, Bonkers, Holiday, Dirtee Disco, Shout, and others.</p><p>Dirtee Stank, his record label, was also founded by him. Mills founded and owns the label, which is co-run by his manager Cage, label manager Laurence Ezra, tour manager Paddy Stewart, and executive producer Teriy Keys.&nbsp;According to Cage, the label seeks to showcase great musicians who have societal issues that could frighten off other companies. It also assists artists in overcoming obstacles like gaining access to studios that transform a raw demo into something that people would get excited about on the street.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dizzee-Rascal-3.jpg alt="Dizzee Rascal" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>More information about Dizzee Rascal’s trial</h2><p>Dizzee Rascal was found guilty of assaulting Cassandra Jones in March 2022 following a trial in which a judge ruled that he had been harsh and belligerent.&nbsp;Mills shoved Cassandra to the ground and forced his forehead on her throughout the trial, Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court heard.
