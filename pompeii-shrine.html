The shrine, known as a lararium, was found set into the wall of a house.</p><p>The elaborate shrine is surrounded by several paintings and murals that depict Gods, animals, and other figures that were important in their culture. The figures painted include a peacock, a pair of snakes, and eggs, which symbolize fertility.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-193772 alt="Pompeii Lararium" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pompeii-lararium.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-193772 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Ciro Fusco/EPA, via Shutterstock</span><span class=caption-body>The shrine, a.k.a. lararium, embedded in the home’s wall in Pompeii.</span></p><p>A mural that might depict a Roman version of the Egyptian god <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anubis</a> also accompanies the shrine. According to Dr. Ingrid Rowland, a professor at the University of Notre Dame, the Pompeiians were “fascinated by Egyptians,” she told The New York Times.</p><p>These stunning paintings have kept their color and vibrancy for thousands of years because of the very thing that caused the demise of their creators: the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. The volcanic ash that spewed from Mount Vesuvius covered the paintings in a thick layer of ash, which kept it safe from outside forces such as wind and light for thousands of years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-193766 alt="Pompeii Painting Found On Ancient Roman Shrine" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pompeii-painting-snakes.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-193766 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Ciro Fusco/ANSA/AP Photo</span><span class=caption-body>A pair of large snakes painted on the lararium.</span></p><p>Shrines like these were an important piece in Roman households. Rowland told The New York Times that every house had some sort of shrine like&nbsp;this but some were more elaborate than others.</p><p>Although the excavations on the house haven’t been completed yet, the team has also uncovered a garden and a pool on the property.</p><p>“Only the wealthiest people could have afforded a lararium&nbsp;inside a special chamber with a raised pool and sumptuous decorations,” Rowland said.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-193767 alt="Snake Painting In Pompeii" width=800 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/snake-painting-pompeii.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-193767 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Ciro Fusco/Parco Archeologico di Pompei</span><span class=caption-body>A snake painting on the lararium.</span></p><p>It is typical of most Roman larariums&nbsp;to show images of snakes, birds, and Gods, as well as symbols of fertility like eggs. Massimo Ossana, the archaeologist leading this excavation, told The New York Times that on the altar just beneath the shrine are remnants of burned offerings that were made to the gods.</p><p>The well-preserved nature of this shrine, its murals, and paintings is remarkable when you think about the utter devastation that befell Pompeii nearly 2,000 years ago.</p><p>When Mount Vesuvius erupted, the Roman writer Pliny the Younger recorded the disaster in great detail, saying that clouds of rock and gas exploded from the volcano “in the form of a very tall trunk, which spread itself out at the top into a sort of branches,” according to History. The death toll from the eruption is said to have reached as high as 30,000.</p><p>Many of the people of Pompeii and the surrounding cities were killed instantly by Vesuvius’ deadly volcanic flow and because of the extreme heat, were frozen in time. Lucky for archaeologists, the same thing that took Pompeii down is exactly what has allowed them to make stunning discoveries such as this.</p><p>Next, take a look at these agonizing photos of <a href=#>Pompeii’s bodies</a> frozen in time.
