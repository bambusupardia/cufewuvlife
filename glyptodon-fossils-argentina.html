He wonders if perhaps the creatures experienced sexual dimorphism, meaning that the size of an individual armadillo would depend on its gender.</p><p>“These kinds of cases, in which several individuals together who died in the same circumstances, are really exceptional and undoubtedly will give us a lot of information about these enigmatic animals and will allow us to test several hypotheses that we have been driving in recent years,” he said.</p><p>Some of the ancient armadillos had shells as long as five feet and as thick as two inches.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to INCUAPA</a>, Glyptodon roamed South America for 30 million years before facing extinction around 10,000 years ago. Some believe early man was to blame for the animal’s disappearance by overusing their hard shells for shelter.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-266676 alt="Washing The Giant Armadillo Fossil" width=900 height=660 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/washing-the-giant-armadillo-fossil.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-266676 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>INCUAPA</span><span class=caption-body>Experts are now eager to assess how and when these animals died, as well as to clarify whether they were sexually dimorphic or not.</span></p><p>As part of the Xenarthra (or Edentata) superorder of mammals, these hefty armadillo ancestors were staunch herbivores. A 2016 DNA test confirmed that Glyptodon were indeed related to modern-day armadillos — the latter of which means “little armored one” in Spanish.</p><p>These creatures naturally evolved an armored exterior to protect themselves against other animals, like an ancient, flightless, carnivorous bird known as the Terror Bird. Even areas not covered by the animal’s shell had bony deposits (osteoderms) as further safeguards.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-266678 alt="Osteoderms Of A Glyptodon" width=800 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/osteoderms-of-a-glyptodon.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-266678 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The animal’s protective shell is made of over 1,000 one-inch-thick bony plates called osteoderms.</span></p><p>The ancient armadillo’s tails, meanwhile, could be wielded as weapons with bony clusters at the end, sometimes even spikes.</p><p>This isn’t the first time a discovery like this was made in the region. In 2015, yet another Argentinian farmer found a three-foot-long shell belonging to a Glyptodon. Farmer Jose Antonio Nievas initially thought he discovered a dinosaur shell.</p><p>Ultimately, he stumbled upon something just as exciting — the remains of a specimen potentially as old as 30 million years.</p><p>As it stands, experts are forging ahead with further testing and are eager to assess just how old these armadillos were when they died, and how they met their end.</p><p>Next, read about <a href=#>the armadillo lizard</a> — a mini-dragon that curls up like an armadillo.
