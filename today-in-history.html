Her murder sparked decades of research into the “bystander effect,” as The New York Times initially reported that dozens of witnesses had seen or heard the attack but failed to do anything about it. Later, however, researchers found police interviews that revealed some people had indeed tried to call authorities. As for the killer, Winston Moseley, he was ultimately found guilty of the 28-year-old bartender’s death and spent the rest of his life in prison.</p><h2>1996: The Dunblane Massacre Takes Place</h2><p>Thomas Hamilton fatally shoots 16 students and a teacher, then kills himself, at Dunblane Primary School near Stirling, Scotland. Hamilton, 43, had previously been accused of inappropriate behavior toward young boys. The <a href=# rel=noopener>Dunblane massacre</a> was the deadliest school shooting in British history, and the tragedy led to heavy firearm restrictions in the United Kingdom, largely outlawing the private ownership of handguns.</p><h2>1997: The Phoenix Lights UFO Incident Occurs</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-406194 alt="Phoenix Lights" width=900 height=511 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/phoenix-lights-newspaper-clipping.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-406194 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A recreation of the V-shaped craft seen during the Phoenix Lights incident of 1997.</span></p><p>Thousands of residents of Arizona and Nevada spot unidentified lights and objects in the sky in what’s now known as the <a href=# rel=noopener>Phoenix Lights</a> incident. Between 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., witnesses called their local police departments with reports of odd sightings, including a V-shaped craft.
