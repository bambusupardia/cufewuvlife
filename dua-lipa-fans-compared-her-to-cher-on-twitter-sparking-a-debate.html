Although Cher’s fervent admirers wholeheartedly backed her, some argued that she was incomparable.</p><p>The artificial rivalry between the two singers started when a Dua Lipa fan account referred to her as “our generation’s Cher.” The user included a video of the two singers dressed similarly and acting similarly.&nbsp;The video has been seen over a million times since the tweet was reposted across many accounts. It should be noted, however, that this isn’t the first time Dua Lipa has been likened to the If I Could Turn Back Time singer. When Lipa wore a Swarovski-covered custom-made Versace gown with a huge butterfly on the bodice in 2021, she was likened to Cher’s 1974 appearance by various people.</p><p>The comparison was also included in the previously stated video.&nbsp;During a 2018 Paris performance, Dua paid tribute to Cher by wearing her classic Bob Mackie nude dress with feathers and the word “Believe” on it. The 76-year-old donned the gown at the Met Gala in 1974.&nbsp;Versace, the fashion company, has also collaborated with the performers. Dua has selected the face of the premium brand in June 2021, according to Paper Magazine. This summer, Cher collaborated with the Italian design business to launch her own brand, Chersace.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dua-Lipa-1.jpg alt=Cher width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Netizens respond to Dua Lipa being dubbed the “Cher of Our Generation.”</h2><p>The tweet’s objective was to complement both singers, but Cher fans argue that Dua Lipa hasn’t had the same impact on the music business as Cher. However, passionate Dua admirers pointed out that she has received several honors and has been acknowledged for her unique fashion style, making her an icon in the same way that Cher is.&nbsp;The unexpected debate raged on Twitter for hours, with netizens clambering over Dua’s celebrity status.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>all dua lipa did was travel across pangea during the pandemic, give us a great album and now y’all hate her because someone compared her to cher 😭 be serious, she probably would disagree herself!</p><p>— 👨🏻‍💻 (@naurveen) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 31, 2022</a></p><h2>Cher gets involved in a Twitter feud</h2><p>As the tweet battle raged on, the After All singer resorted to Twitter to inquire how many years were in a generation.

Floral earrings, strappy shoes, a black purse, and a few rings completed the No Lie singer’s look.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Cher.jpg alt=Cher width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The wedding was held in a southern French town, and guests were compelled to walk down a street to the ceremony.
