She was based in Oklahoma City. Neena spent her youth in Tampa, Florida, despite the fact that she was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p><p>In May of 2017, she graduated from the University of South Florida with a bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Leadership Studies. She then went on to pursue other opportunities. During her time at USF, she participated as a member of the women’ ball group (2013-2016).</p><p>She worked as an anchor and journalist for Florida Focus, a news brief that was shown on the local PBS-WUSF channel, during the semester while she was in her final year of college.

To tell you the truth, Neena was a fan of the Green Bay Packers before she moved to the badger state. Her mother’s side of the family is originally from Wisconsin, so it was only natural for her to root for the Packers.</p><p>She loves everything about north-central Wisconsin, especially all of the cafes in the area, noisy cheddar curds, and a weekend excursion into the Northwoods to relax.</p><p>In 2019, she also adopted a cat from the Portage County Humane Society who was given the name Murphie.</p><h2><span id=Neena_Pacholke_WAOW_9_News>Neena Pacholke WAOW 9 News</span></h2><p>In May of 2017, Pacholke became a member of the News 9 team.
