So come and join me as I delve into thousands of episodes of Ash and Pikachu's adventures (and maybe some from Liko and Roy if any pop up) and sort out the crap from the good in my own witty and amusing way.</p><p>The first episode that has been cherry picked from this generator is <b>Grooming Furfrou</b> which is Episode 8 of the <b>XY</b> series.</p><p>It is fairly amusing that I've made such a big introduction as there's actually quite little to talk about this one - it's your usual filler episode where the gang meets the COTD of the day, have a gander at what they're doing and then Team Rocket show up, they battle them and send them blasting off and then they say farewell to said COTD and head off to their next destination.</p><p>This description fits this episode perfectly to a tee but the one bit that is particularly cool is when Pikachu gets sprayed by ink which leaves him unable to see what's happening during the battle.</p><p>In Episode 3 of the original Kanto era when a similar event happened this basically forced Pikachu out of the battle leaving Ash to use another one of his Pokémon, but here Pikachu actually continues battling Team Rocket's Pokémon with his eyes shut and it's almost as if he and Ash are one in a way and shows just how far they've both come.</p><p>It's just the little things like that which makes me smile. And I suppose it makes Ash look cooler which is what they seemed to be doing for the Kalos era of the anime.</p><p>3/5<br>"I love me those Ash and Pikachu moments."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/attachments/1000001460-png.187946/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt=1000001460.png title=1000001460.png width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><i>Silly girl, you know you can't beat that trap up with a stick.</i><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyzsdOrpqmnm5qzorrSZqmappSkum68zqScpqeeYrKxtdKom55lkqG8qHqSaWhuaGRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
