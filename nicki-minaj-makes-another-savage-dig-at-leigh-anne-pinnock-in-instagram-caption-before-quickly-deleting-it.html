We got all Leigh jelly btchs akkin all messy #Boyzoutnow.”</p><p>She added: “Yall know it’s all love chile.”</p><p>Soon after she swapped Leigh’s name for the word ‘these’ but the original comment had already been seen thousands of times.</p><p>During their livestream, Jesy giggled while Nicki slammed <a href=#>Leigh-Anne for her “leaked messages” </a>accusing her former bandmate of ‘blackfishing’.</p><p><a href=#>Blackfishing</a> is a term used when a white person uses black culture and aesthetics for their own gain.</p><p>The DMs added that <a href=#>Jesy</a> had “blocked and cut off” her, <a href=#>Perrie Edwards</a>, and <a href=#>Jade Thirlwall</a>.</p><p>Posting on her Instagram Story, Nicki wrote ahead of the Insta Live: “Jesy, we got all these jelly btchs actin real messy” – and she did not hold back as the evening went on.</p><p>Furiously lashing out at Leigh-Anne, Nicki slammed the singer for “waiting until Jesy had parted” from <a href=#>Little Mix </a>before speaking out – claiming that she was “jealous and insecure”.</p><p>She ranted: “When you try to bring someone down because you see them continuing to try and pursue their careers, you are a f***ing clown. And let me tell you, there’s a lot of women out here in the US that tan and get bigger lips.</p><p>“As long as you’re not hurting anyone you should be able to embrace your body, your make-up.”</p><p>With Jesy nodding along, Nicki continued: “If you’ve ever done business with someone then you send a text message when they try and do something else, trying to end them – you’ve already ended your f***ing self. You won’t go anywhere because your heart ain’t right.”</p><p>Discussing “hate trains” of people wanting to end Jesy’s career, she continued: “What we won’t have is putting out text messages to try and ruin someone, and telling people and influencers to talk badly about this girl.</p><p>“Unless someone is pretending they’re a race they’re not and lying, sweetheart, take them text messages and shove them up your f***ing a** because when you do clown s**t I have to speak to you and talk to you like you’re a clown.</p><p>“You don’t have to try and ruin anyone – you’re in this woman’s group and don’t talk about this s**t for 10 years and now you’ve seen she has a video coming with Diddy? Print those text messages out and shove them up your a**.</p><p>“If you want a solo career, just say that – you can go out and do your own music, you don’t have to attack someone else. It screams insecurity, you’re jealous – only jealous people do things like this, and now you look like a big, jealous Bozo.”</p><p>Jesy did not address the Leigh-Anne situation directly, but laughed as Nicki ranted, and later thanked her for defending her.</p><p>She also insisted that she didn’t mean to offend anybody – and her tan and curls are completely natural.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/jesy2-2.png><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Jesy Nelson admits Little Mix bandmate Leigh-Anne DID warn her against Blackfishing last year – as she insists tan and curly hair’s natural</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnp6wrLWMpqCnmZpiuqK3xKxkmqafqbWmvoysmK%2BZl5p6pbXGZpitZZyatqi0jJqlp51dpbavus6comahnmK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1isKK806Kmp2WSmrOwvsRmqK6hk6C5unnDnqOerJmjtG6102g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
