He now faces three counts of murder and related charges, according to police.</p><p>“This is a total random act of violence, which we may never get to the bottom of and uncover why,” said Philadelphia Police Capt. Jason Smith.</p><p>Smith said the 21-year-old suspect has been silent since being taken into custody.</p><p>There is no connection between Jones and the three victims, the police captain said. Detectives were able to determine that the slayings were connected, however, because Jones allegedly followed a near-exact script for both hits.</p><p>Smith said detectives were able to connect the killings—on June 28 and July 7—to Jones using security footage, which tracked the shootings themselves and Jones fleeing to his apartment.</p><p>The victim of the first shooting was identified as 20-year-old Zamir Syrus. Footage captured him getting on a public bus around 10 p.m. and deboarding 15 minutes later. Jones, meanwhile, boarded one stop before Syrus and got off one stop later, Smith said.</p><p>Once both were off the bus, police say Jones and Syrus walked toward each other from seperate directions. Once they passed each other, Jones turned around, pulled out a gun and ran toward Syrus while firing “several shots at the victim’s back,” Smith said.</p><p>Syrus was taken to a local hospital but died there.</p><p>The next shooting, on July 7, was eerily similar to the first. But this time, police say, Jones killed two men in the attack.</p><p>Justin Robert Smith, 20, and Tyheim Tucker, 21, hopped off a public bus in North Philadelphia around 10:40 p.m. Jones, also on the bus, stepped off a stop later, Smith said. From here, the second slaying is said to mirror the first, except neither Smith nor Tucker were taken to a hospital after being gunned down. They were pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>If it weren’t for his arrest Thursday, Smith suggested Jones may have struck again soon. The raid of his apartment uncovered a Glock handgun outfitted with an extended magazine and 31 live rounds inside—the same caliber bullets that were used in the shootings, police said.</p><p>Smith said the handgun did not have a listed owner. He added that Jones was barred from legally owning weapons after he was busted stealing a vehicle and convicted of other firearm charges in 2019, crimes he was still on probation for at the time of the killings.</p><p>“The motive is unknown, but that is the burning question,” Smith said. “Why? Why did Mr. Jones murder, in cold blood, three males?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6S9tHnNmplmqJieua3FjKaYp2WUmr%2BztcKkZKOnnprAbq3CnKysnZRivKd50qWYsqGenHp0ecinZKuZnpm8rnnAppmuq5iawHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
