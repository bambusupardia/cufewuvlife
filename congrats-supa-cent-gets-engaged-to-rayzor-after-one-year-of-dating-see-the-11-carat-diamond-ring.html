Unfortunately, Supa shared with her followers that the ensemble didn’t quite fit–but she didn’t let that get in the way of her important day. Instead, she rocked a chic Fendi shirt and some black pants, still looking perfectly prepared for the occasion.</p><p>Leading up to the proposal, the couple got to enjoy a ride on a New Orleans streetcar that was filled with pictures of them hanging from the ceiling. Luckily for fans–and for the pair to look back on–her best friend, Bee Marie, captured the finale on camera.</p><p>When the pair arrived at another venue, Supa opened the door and dropped to her knees in tears as she saw her boyfriend standing in front of big white letters that read, “Marry Me.” The entrepreneur was clearly overwhelmed with emotion, but she was eventually able to calm down enough to say yes!</p><p>While the gestures involved in the proposal were more than enough, Ray also made sure the ice was right, hooking Supa up with an eleven-carat diamond engagement ring. She took to Instagram to show off her new jewelry and more details from the special day, writing in her caption, “My heart stopped today! The easiest ‘yes’ I’ve ever said.”</p><p>Congratulations to the happy couple!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnKann6KWwbR50q6nmmWTmru1ecaeq6xllaO0orPEnWStp12nrrrGzqtkmp6kmr9uu82eZLKdkad6sLKMnZitoZ6cerSxxGaroZ1dZn5ur8CrmK1llJ6urrvNnWSroZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
