There’s a lot going on in Big Mouth Season 5’s first episode, but one of its funniest jokes involves Nanjiani, a deeply upsetting YouTube video, and some Jeff Bezos shade.</p><p>Before we get into the slight, here’s what you’re getting into. Big Mouth is Netflix’s raunchy and deeply vulgar show about puberty. Every episode takes a great amount of joy in illustrating the relentless horrors of puberty. Remember every awkward question you had about your body that you were too afraid to ask even your friends? There’s a good chance Big Mouth has dedicated at least two episodes to the disturbing answer.</p><p>Which brings us to Kumail Nanjiani’s Season 5 cameo. After going through a breakup, the typically horny Jay (Jason Mantzoukas) realizes that he can’t jack off without thinking about his ex. Instead of dealing with those emotions in an emotionally healthy way, he convinces his friends to try No Nut November with him. And who’s a better spokesperson for this odd tradition than mega-buff Eternals star Kumail Nanjiani? Honestly, probably a lot of people. But Big Mouth went with this comedy star, turned jacked man beast.</p><p>“What’s up Kumaniacs?” an animated Nanjiani says as he lifts various weights. “Ever since I stopped nutting, my life’s been Mark Wahlberg good. So what are the rules? Easy. One month of no sex, no masturbation, no wet dreams. No nutting in any form.”</p><p>All of the kids agree to take on Jay’s weird challenge for their own reasons. But because this is Big Mouth we’re talking about, Nanjiani appears later in the episode to encourage Jay, only this time he appears as Cum Kumail. He’s exactly what he sounds like, essentially a ghost made out of ejaculate that looks like Nanjiani. As Jay unfollows Lola from his various social media accounts, Cum Kumail says, “Yes, Jay. That’s sick. The Big Sick. Only on Amazon Prime… unfortunately.”</p><p>If you missed The Big Sick, you’re probably not alone. Directed by Michael Showalter and based on the real-life courtship of Nanjiani and his now-wife Emily V. Gordon, The Big Sick has everything you could ever want in a rom-com. It’s genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, has an excellent cast that includes Ray Romano and Holly Hunter, and contains real emotional stakes. After all, the whole movie is about Emily (Zoe Kazan) falling into a coma after she breaks up with Kumail (Nanjiani), forcing Kumail to navigate the heartache of Emily’s recovery alongside her parents. It’s a great movie that’s almost guaranteed to make you both laugh and cry. Also, because it was produced by both Amazon Studios and Lionsgate, it’s only available to stream on Amazon Prime Video. That’s the unfortunate part.</p><p>But don’t be too sad, Cum Kumail. Maybe this extra gross plug is the push people need to seek out your underrated movie.</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link>Watch Big Mouth on Netflix<br></a></p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link>Watch The Big Sick on Prime Video<br></a></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnm6q6orXLZqWappqerq%2B1jKyfmpyVqHqiucCzpqerXZe2qHnSopqkZaKauaat0p5koqZdl7aoecyorK2gXaiyor%2FOp2RuZaCnsq61xKucaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
