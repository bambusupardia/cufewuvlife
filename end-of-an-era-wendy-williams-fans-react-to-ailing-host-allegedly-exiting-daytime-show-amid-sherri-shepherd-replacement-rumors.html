Reportedly, The Wendy Williams Show will officially be ending in June after airing on daytime tv since 2008 according to an exclusive report made by <a href=# rel=noopener>B. Scott</a> over the weekend. The outlet said sources from the show not only confirmed that <strong>Wendy Williams’</strong> iconic talk show is ending but also revealed comedian <strong>Sherri Shepard</strong> is already set to replace her spot with her own show this fall.</p><p>“The producers informed everyone that the [Wendy Show] was being canceled at the end of June. Then in the next breath they hired everyone to work on the new Sherri show.”</p><p>The same source added that Wendy has lost access to her ‘Wendy Show’ Instagram account after the 57-year-old popped up with a brand new verified IG account over the weekend.</p><p>Wendy has been on medical leave from her show since December, but the unnamed source says her tension with the show started well before nursing herself from Graves disease. The outlet said its production sources noted that Williams had been having ‘tantrums’ prior to taking sick leave, allegedly indicating that she didn’t want to be there.</p><p>‘[Wendy had] become somewhat unbearable, having tantrums and throwing things at people. Basically, the consensus among the crew is that she didn’t wanna be there anymore. Her illnesses may have exacerbated that feeling.”</p><p>Wendy’s fans and celebrity friends reacted to news of the show’s cancellation with kind words, and tributes to her impact on television. “The Real” co-host and comedian <strong>Loni Love</strong> shared on Twitter:</p><p>‘Wendy Williams revolutionized daytime tv.. this woman would open her show BY HERSELF for 20 minutes and keep the audience captivated! Agree or disagree with her no one can deny her skill for talk. I have learned a lot from you Wendy Williams and wish you well.’</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wendy Williams revolutionized daytime tv.. this woman would open her show BY HERSELF for 20 minutes and keep the audience captivated!
