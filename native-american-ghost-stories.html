Out of fear of conjuring or insulting them, these forest spirits are instead referred to as Stick People, or sometimes “Stick Indians.”</p><p>Numerous tribes have stories about Stick People. The Salish describe them as Bigfoot-like beasts, the Nez Pearce say that they’re more like little people, and some tribes say that they appear a lot like humans.</p><p>But all agree — the Stick People are hot-tempered and mischievous. Their <a href=# rel=noopener>“stick” nickname possibly comes</a> from the joy they derive from poking sticks in tepees.</p><p>Said to roam the deep forests of the Pacific Northwest, the Stick People are usually spotted at night. They’re often seen snatching fish from nets, nabbing clothes from men, and stealing food.</p><p>But be warned — trying to stop or hinder these forest spirits can be deadly. Infamously vindictive, legend states that it doesn’t take much to set them off. They can drive people insane, kidnap them, or simply devour them.</p><p>Stick People can be hard to avoid, however. Because they are also said to shapeshift, these roguish and dangerous spirits can easily take on the appearance of a wild animal. Often, they’ll even lure people into the woods by mimicking animals or whistling.</p><p>Of all their abilities, the Stick People’s desire to seek revenge is their most defining feature. No matter how small the slight, they will bear a grudge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyvrdOirZ5lkaKys7XCmqVmn5ikwLV50q2mq6GVqHx3</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
