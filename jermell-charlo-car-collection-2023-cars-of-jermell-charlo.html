From a stunningly-designed exterior to its first-class cabin, the GLS 600 offers luxury, unlike any other high-riding Merc. Under the hood lies a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that makes 550 hp along with 538 lb-ft of torque. Apart from the incredibly performing engine to its ultra-luxury cabin, the GLS 600 is built for the wealthiest of people. From the fine leather-stiched interior, and messaging seats, to the champagne refrigerator, the Maybach GLS600 is among the best luxury SUVs.</p><h2 id=2-lamborghini-aventador-s class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading"><span id=2_Lamborghini_Aventador_S>2.

Aventador is powered by a 6.5L Naturally-Aspirated V12 Engine pumping out a generous output of almost 730 horsepower and 690 NM of Torque. The amazing and superfast Lambo can go up to the top speed of 217 mph and 0-60 in just 2.9 seconds which is crazily fast. Aventador S comes with a price tag of approximately $670,000.</p><h2 id=3-rollsroyce-cullinan class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading"><span id=3_Rolls-Royce_Cullinan>3.

With the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Rolls-Royce Cullinan</strong></a>, the British luxury carmaker has offered the best of their craftsmanship packed into a high-riding practical design. It seems practicality is an overstatement to call, the Cullinan offers a badge of prestige with a refinement the brand is known for. From its brilliantly designed exterior to a handstitched interior made with precise and rich materials. The new Rolls SUV offers a super-refined V12 that makes 563 hp that delivers a buttery smooth drive.</p><h2 id=4-lamborghini-urus class="rb-heading-index-4 wp-block-heading"><span id=4_Lamborghini_Urus>4.

Not only to justify its twin-turbo 4.0-Litre V8 making between 641 and 657 horsepower, but also by its mind-splattering performance on famous racetracks. This high-riding Lambo is the only thing from the brand that can pull a trailer and haul more than two. While its quarter-million-dollar price puts it way out of the league for most of us mere mortals, its interior isn’t as special as it should be for such a huge wad of cash.</p><h2 id=5-mercedes-g63-amg class="rb-heading-index-5 wp-block-heading"><span id=5_Mercedes_G63_AMG>5.
