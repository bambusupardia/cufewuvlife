While it isn't by far the only Pokémon with an illegal move, it is one of the two that had that move removed in a later patch, the other being Stockpile Shuckle. <a href=# class=new title="User:Rainingblues (page does not exist)">Rainingblues</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Rainingblues">talk</a>) 07:25, 14 January 2017 (UTC)</p>It isn't really a trivium about Kommo-o <i>the species</i>, though. It already exists at <a href=# title="Pokémon Sun and Moon">Pokémon Sun and Moon#Version history</a>, and I think we could even perhaps comfortably add it as a trivium on <a href=# title="Battle Tree">Battle Tree</a>, but it's not relevant to Kommo-o as a species, in my opinion, so I don't think it belongs here. <a href=# title=User:Pumpkinking0192>Pumpkinking0192</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Pumpkinking0192">talk</a>) 16:47, 14 January 2017 (UTC) Plus, we have the page <a href=# title="Game move errors">Game move errors</a> for this sort of trivia. <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=User:Xolroc>Xolroc</a> (<a href=# class=mw-redirect title="User talk:Xolroc">talk</a>) 16:50, 14 January 2017 (UTC)<h2><span id=Shiny_sprite.3F></span><span class=mw-headline id=Shiny_sprite?>Shiny sprite?</span></h2><p>Kommo-o can be shiny, right?
