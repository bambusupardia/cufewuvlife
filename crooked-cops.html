Of course, he never mentioned this on his application.</p><p>He even wrote a book in 1992, Mafia Cop: The Story of an Honest Cop Whose Family Was in the Mob. Evidently, Eppolito wasn’t quite the honest cop he made himself out to be.</p><p>While working for the Lucchese family’s boss, Anthony “Gaspipe” Casso, Eppolito and Caracappa tracked down and murdered prominent members of rival families. But their spree wasn’t limited to just mobsters — they also killed a diamond dealer, a painters’ union leader, and a man suspected of leaking mob secrets to law enforcement.</p><p>But <a href=# rel=noopener>Stephen Caracappa</a> made a mistake, and when he was asked to hunt down one of Casso’s enemies, a man named Nicholas Guido, he pulled the address of a different, innocent Nicholas Guido, and killed the wrong man.</p><p>Then, in the mid-90s, massive crackdowns led to arrests in every major New York crime family. Eppolito and Caracappa moved to Las Vegas, claiming to have retired from mob activity while actually dealing drugs and unsuccessfully planning the murders of former mobsters to protect their past.</p><p>In the end, Casso proved to be a poor choice of friend. He reported Caracappa and Eppolito’s involvement to the police in 1994.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-392838 alt="Anthony Casso And Al D'Arco" width=900 height=571 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/anthony-casso-and-al-darco.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-392838 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Federal Bureau of Investigation</span><span class=caption-body>Lucchese Mob Boss Anthony Casso with capo Alphonso D’Arco in an FBI surveillance photo.</span></p><p>And in 1998, while being interviewed from prison for 60 Minutes, he said, “I have two detectives that work the major squad team for the New York Police Department. Lou Eppolito and Steve — he’s got a long last name, Ca… Capis…”</p><p>Casso ratted out his former hitmen to try and get a reduced sentence. He didn’t, but the police couldn’t prove his allegations either.</p><p>The consequences for Caracappa and Eppolito finally came in 2005 when Brooklyn gangster Burton Kaplan flipped sides and provided crucial testimony in the case against them.</p><p>Both men eventually died in prison. Caracappa died in 2017 of stage IV cancer, and Eppolito died in 2019, <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a> reported, but no cause of death was made public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykvs6oop6cXZi8sb8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
