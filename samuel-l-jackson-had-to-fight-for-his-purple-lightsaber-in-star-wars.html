Jackson had to fight for his purple lightsabre</p><p>The 73-year-old actor, who played Mace Windu in ‘Star Wars’ Episodes I, II, and III of the blockbuster franchised and explained why he wanted his character to have a purple lightsaber.</p><p>When asked how the purple lightsaber came about on the ‘Happy Sad Confused’ podcast, he answered: “Ask George [Lucas]. In Episode II, there’s that huge scene in kind of like a war stadium. There’s all these Jedi out there. And when I was reading it I was like ‘how am I going to find myself in this?’ So I thought, ‘different colored lightsaber!’ So I said, ‘George, can I get a purple colored lightsaber?’ [And he said,] ‘they’re green, they’re blue.’ I said, ‘what, seriously, that’s it?’ And that was the end of the conversation.”</p><p>Though the ‘Avengers’ star thought he’d lost the fight at this point, he revealed the moment when director George Lucas, 77, told Samuel he’d changed his mind.</p><p>He explained: “But then we finished shooting reshoots, I had to fly back to London, and he was like ‘I want to show you something,’ and I was like ‘what?’ So he shows me a purple lightsaber. But then he says, ‘it’s already causing a s***storm online, so I don’t know if I’m going to keep it,’ and I was like ‘really? Come on! And how do people online know anyway?’</p><p>“But sure enough, when the movie opened, he was like, ‘okay. You get to keep the purpe lightsaber.’ Because in episode one, I never even got to pull it.”</p><p>The ‘Pulp Fiction’ star also confessed that he believes Mace Windu is still alive, and would hinted that he could reprise his role in the ‘Star Wars’ universe.</p><p>Samuel revealed: “I think [Mace Windu] is alive somewhere. … There’s a huge history of people with one hand returning in ‘Star Wars.’ The only person I’ve ever said that to, about coming back, was Bryce Dallas Howard. I just did a movie with her, and she directs episodes of ‘The Mandalorian.’ So I was like, ‘do you think you might be able to hook a brother up? I mean, you like me, right?’ And she’s like ‘I love you, you’re amazing!’ So I said ‘put me back in it.’ I’ll learn to use the lightsaber left-handed!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrJimrZWheq15yZqapKufo3qprcNmq6hllp60qcCMn6arZZiewG681KunpZ1dobaotNOsmJudomK2r3nSrZirZaeWv7R7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
