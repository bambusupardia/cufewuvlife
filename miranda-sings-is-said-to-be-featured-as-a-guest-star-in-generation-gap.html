She is one of the most popular online stars, having been active on YouTube for almost a decade. Despite being a skilled singer, she plays Miranda Sings as an untalented lady who feels she is destined for stardom.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Miranda-Sings-2.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Miranda Sings is noted for her overdrawn red lips, narcissism, speaking in accents, addressing her “haters,” and singing poorly in an off-key and off-rhythm voice. She is well-known for sometimes expressing politically incorrect and insulting views.&nbsp;The persona was inspired by actual ladies in her collegiate vocal performance department, as well as a variety of YouTube videos of less-talented individuals. It’s a spoof on the many narcissistic singers on the popular streaming site that record themselves singing while receiving criticism.</p><p>In February 2008, Ballinger released the first video of her fictitious persona, a version of Aretha Franklin’s Respect, on her YouTube account Miranda Sings, and “never dreamed anybody would ever see it.”&nbsp;In fact, she was “quite startled” when the films became viral in 2009.” The channel now has 10.8M subscribers.</p><p>Trent, Rachel, and Chris Ballinger, her three siblings, reared her in Santa Barbara, California. As a child, she aspired to be a model but instead studied vocal performance at Azusa Pacific University in California to pursue her passion for singing and performing. She was often tormented in school. Her granddad, who died in 2011, was “encouraged” by her profession.&nbsp;Ballinger was formerly married to YouTuber Joshua Evans, but the pair divorced in 2016. In 2018, she married her Haters Back Off co-star Erik Stocklin and gave birth to their son Flynn Timothy Stocklin. She gave birth to twins Maisy Joanne and Wesley Koy Stocklin In 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Miranda-Sings-3.jpg alt="Miranda Sings" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In her 14 years of popularity, Miranda Sings has had her own Netflix series (Haters Back Off), performed on Broadway, featured on several late-night talk programs, and authored two books, Self-Helf (2015) and My Diarrhe (2018), all written from her point of view.</p><p>She also became well-known for her own vlogging channel, Colleen Ballinger, which has 8.75 million followers. The multi-talented celebrity has also performed in Ireland, Canada, and Australia, among other places. She’s also appeared in London, Hollywood, and Pennsylvania. Ballinger has an estimated net worth of $8 million.&nbsp;The actress will now be seen reprising her role as Miranda Sings in the upcoming Generation Gap episode, which will air on Thursday on ABC.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikoqqRo7GiedKipaCrXZ7Abr%2FAoptmrJ9ir6Z5xZ6Yra2imrFurdJmmGafpZrAtXnSrZirZZmjeqixzZ6pmqyZpLtus8CpZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
