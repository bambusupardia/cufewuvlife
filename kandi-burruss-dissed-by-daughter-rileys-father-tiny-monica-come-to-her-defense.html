She responded to his words.</p><p>“My mom and I always try to take the high road,” Riley wrote. “But honestly it’s really upsetting that I constantly have to see you badmouthing us publicly. I was blessed to be raised in a household where my mom provided the best life I could have. No jealousy here. I would appreciate it if you could stop talking about us.”</p><p>Over on her Instagram Story, Kandi reshared a post that reads, “I don’t care how well I’m doing, I still need that money you owe me.” She added, “Don’t BLOCK your blessings not doing right by your children.” Kandi’s friend, R&B icon Monica, shared a photo of Kandi and Riley with a supportive message.&nbsp;</p><p>“Sending extra love and light to one of the greatest moms I know,” the singer said. “[Kandi] you’ve always gone above and beyond for your children & [Riley] is a shining example Of just how amazing you are! Love you both.” That was precious, but Kandi’s best friend Tameka “Tiny” Harris took a more…direct…approach.</p><p>“Man this is a bunch of bullish*t! Just cause she makes more money u shouldn’t give her money to help with y’all’s child,” said Tiny. “It’s bad enough u never acted like she existed. That man was absent for years on years at a time [eye roll emoji] Riley balled out her whole life & ain’t stopped yet!! Them single mama’s don’t play bout they baby’s they just go harder. He should be thanking Kandi instead of talkn [poop emoji].”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOpJinnJlir7a%2B0a6qrGWUnsC0scNmmbJllJbCqLTTnqlmqpmhsrq%2FjJ%2BYraCVp3q1tc2yZKannp6wonnCqKSeZaSkeqmx0Wabnp6Vo8Cmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
