The whole story of #blackAF revolves around the star cast, Kenya Barris’ as pictured as a fictionalized version of himself.

Rather than a relationship, it looks like a bit of competition in both of them.</p><p>Although they made a trip to Fiji to get over the messy things later, Kenya found that the trip was just part of a shared business, and it caused much tension among them.

It will be so thrilling to watch this upcoming season, which will reveal the end of Kenya and Joya’s relationship whether the couple will end up happy or finally choose to part their ways apart. Once the trailer has been off its season 2, then we will come with a broader storyline.</p><p>Till then, stay attuned with us for more latest updates.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK57zZ6rn6SZrXqjuMCcopqeXaiyor%2FOp2RrZaKauaat0p5knZmkmnqkrdKtZKmkn6l6tb7AoqOeql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
