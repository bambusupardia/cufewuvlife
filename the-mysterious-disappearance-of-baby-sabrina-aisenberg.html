Police have continued to investigate this case over the years, following various leads, but unfortunately, the case remains an <a href=# rel=noopener>unsolved mystery</a>, with Sabrina is still missing as of 2022.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Inside Edition</a>, in an interview with the Aisenbergs in 2018, the couple stated that a 20-year-old woman reached out to them claiming to be their missing daughter. The anonymous woman reportedly does not have pictures from her life from the time she was 5 to 9 months old and is around the same age as Sabrina would have been. Even more surprisingly, another woman reached out to the couple, also claiming to be Sabrina.</p><p dir=ltr>Both the Aisenbergs and the two women involved were willing to submit to a <a href=# rel=noopener>DNA test</a> to confirm or deny their identities. The tests proved the women were not Sabrina, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Cinemaholic</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Following the disappearance of their baby daughter, the Aisenbergs moved their remaining children to Maryland in 1999. Today, the couple still lives there and both of them work as real estate agents. Though baby Sabrina has been missing all of this time, her parents reportedly have always kept a room for her in their home. The Aisenbergs still believe their little girl is out there somewhere and will be coming home someday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6m1pnnMsqqtnaKevLa%2FjJ2grJmgpbKivsCnmp5ln5t6o63BsmSsmZKntq%2BtjJqgrJ2el7Kzs44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
