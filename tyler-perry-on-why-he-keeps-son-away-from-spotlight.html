The entertainment mogul recently sat down with AARP to talk about his life as a father and why he is passionate about keeping his personal life private.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ve waited 27 years to tell this story. <a href=#>https://t.co/nOerOMBr64</a></p><p>— Tyler Perry (@tylerperry) <a href=#>July 26, 2022</a></p><p>“These people are not famous,” Tyler shared with <a href=#>the publication</a>. Perry welcomed his son with his then-partner, Gelila Bekele, in 2014. He made it a point to not announce his expectancy and rarely discusses his son when interviewing with the press.</p><p>“My son’s not famous,” Perry shared with <a href=# rel=noopener>AARP</a>. “I want him to have as normal a life as he can,” the celebrity father said. “I want him to know what it’s like to have his own name and his own life and not have the pressure of trying to live up to whatever or whoever your father was.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>When I was in my early 30s I didn’t know <a href=#>@Oprah</a> very well, but she gave me an experience that changed my life and set me on a path that has allowed me to try and do the same for many others.

His first play, I Know I’ve Been Changed, made its debut during the 90s and was not received well. Tyler, who believed in his vision from the start, quit his mainstream job to bring the play to life. The effect of leaving his traditional job was homelessness. Perry spent three months in his car but never lost his determination to do great things in the entertainment industry. Now, he serves as an employer to many up-and-coming actors and an advocate for justice.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well everybody!

So, the moment he loses that innocence is going to be a very, very sad day for me,” Perry admitted.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I HAVE NO WORDS!!
