Well, it’s late April, and Nintendo revealed in a press release that the update is coming tonight (April 24), as well as giving more details about what the update will entail.</p><p>It was revealed in the press release that the Version 3.0 update will be available for&nbsp;Splatoon 2&nbsp;players tonight at 6:00pm PST/9:00pm EST. This free update will include over one hundred pieces of new gear, some of which is new and some of which is returning from the first&nbsp;Splatoon; new songs from the in-game band Chirpy Chips, a chiptune band from the first game; new weapons and stages, including Piranha Pit, Camp Triggerfish and Wahoo World; and several general weapon balancing adjustments and bug fixes. Also, Callie of the Squid Sisters will make an appearance as part of this new update. After meeting a specific, unspecified condition, Callie will appear&nbsp;in Tentakeel Outpost in Octo Canyon to offer the player their recent multiplayer stats.</p><p>The biggest addition this update brings to&nbsp;Splatoon 2&nbsp;is the new X Rank, which can be attained by the very best, and most competitive, online players. Upon downloading the update, all players who currently hold the S+10 Rank will attain X Rank. However, just reaching X Rank doesn’t mean you’ve achieved your goal and you can just sit back and relax. Those with X Rankings will battle each other for an X Power level. Once a month, the five hundred players from each Ranked Battle mode with the highest X Power levels will be announced via SplatNet 2. Additionally, X Power levels will be reset at the end of each month, with players who haven’t reached a certain threshold being reduced back to S+9 Rank. So not only do you have to earn your X Rank in the first place, but you have to continually prove that you deserve it to keep it. The first X Power reset will take place on May 31 and subsequent X Power resets will occur on the last day of each month.</p><p>You can read the full update notes for Version 3.0 <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p style=color:#ff4343;font-size:14px;font-style:italic></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfo7K4v46sp6WZpKS8r3mRZq2eql1oenF51KmbmqyVYrCwucinnmasn6O2qLTTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
