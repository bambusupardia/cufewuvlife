They’re going to believe Barkin.”</p><p>Grace also discussed Disney executive Tina Newman’s testimony that Heard’s Washington Post op-ed was the reason behind Depp’s loss of his role as Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of Caribbean” franchise.</p><p>“Blah blah blah,” Grace said. “I don’t believe her and here’s why: The op-ed came out, and very shortly after that, he was cut loose. Two and two still equal four.”</p><p>Still, she said, Thursday’s testimony was damaging to Depp’s case.</p><p>“All these witnesses talking about him spiraling, that he was so high, that he was so drunk, that he was so late,” she said. “Have you ever made a crew wait six hours? I haven’t. They don’t like it. Idon’t care how affable and likable he is, if he became unreliable, even in Hollywood, he was radioactive.”</p><p>“He is his own undoing, not Amber Heard.”</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.</strong></p><p>[Featured image: Fox News screenshot]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5%2B8qbrNsmSdnaCleqq%2FjKGgrGWfrLtuwc2dpqKml2K7sMCMmqSbnaJitaat0Z1knKqZorJuu82loKedXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
