Bug types would probably have the shortest lifespan on average. An exception for example would be Volcarona, who I think can get a lot older than most other Bug</p><p>In general, Psychic, Dark, Steel, Ground and Rock types can also have a long life span, but that also depends on the species. Grass types probably have the potential for a long life, but don't necessarily always have one</p><p>Egg groups can probably also be a helpful guidelines, like most things in the Dragon egg group probably have a very long lifespan, or the pokémon in the human-like egg group might have a relatively long lifespan (maybe not as long as a humans, but maybe at least half of it?)</p><p>I also think evolution might be able to prolong a pokémon's lifespan</p><p>and obviously Legendaries are excluded from this, not because I think they're all immortal, but because I think most of them have at least a pretty long lifespan, even if they don't have a typing that would support that (Ho-oh for example, which is Fire/Flying, two elements I think don't necessarily guarantee a long lifespan, but also based on the phoenix, which is reborn from its ash and all)</p><p>As for Vivillion's question, I guess pokémon like that could do either? Like, I imagine that it will show the wear and tear of old age at some point, but not randomly fall apart. They probably decompose differently a well (maybe certain Steel types just rust away?)</p><p>Oh and lastly, yes I think Ghost pokémon can die, as I don't think they're dead pokémon/people, as much as their beings with traits we attribute to ghosts (levitating, disappearing, lack of physical body) So I guess that when their time has come, they slowly cease to exist and disperse into nothingness? (though I think Ghost types generally get really old, so it doesn't happen that often/quickly)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXaG2p7HSqZinZmFrhnWAkGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
