Bliss (30) said in the interview that Michael Gregory Mizanin (aka The Miz) acquainted the two.&nbsp;According to Bliss’ description of their meeting, Miz had questioned Cabrera about her, and he was unaware of her WWE fame. She said,</p><p>“So Miz, Ryan’s closest buddy, contacted him and inquired about his relationship with Alexa Bliss, and Ryan had no idea who I was. Miz eventually told him it was a female he works with. Then we began talking, and he invited me to one of his gigs and asked [sic] where I was from.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ryan-Cabrera-1.jpg alt="Ryan Cabrera" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cabrera reportedly invited Bliss to his Orlando event and then asked her out afterward. However, the wrestler apparently declined the offer at the time. Bliss went on to say:</p><p>“I ended up going to the event, and he offered me out afterward, which I declined, but we kept talking, and he was incredibly patient and persistent, and we became fantastic friends. It eventually blossomed into a wonderful partnership. He’s really kind and talented.”</p><h2>They dated for a year before getting engaged.</h2><p>Alexa Bliss and Ryan Cabrera began dating after meeting at some time in late 2019.
